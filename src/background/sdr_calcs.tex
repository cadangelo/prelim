\subsection{SDR calculations}
Shutdown dose rate (SDR) calculations are necessary to quantify the potential
dose to personnel working in facilities exposed to intense radiation fields
like fusion energy systems (FES).  The dose rate is caused by decay photons
that are emitted by materials irradiated by neutrons.  Therefore, these calculations involve a neutron
transport step, then an activation analysis to determine the decay photon
spectrum for a specific irradiation and decay scenario,
and finally a photon transport step to determine the dose rate.
One methodology for calculating the SDR is known as the Rigorous Two Step (R2S)
method.  This method relies on a MC code for both neutron and photon transport
and a nuclear inventory code for activation analysis.
The goal of the neutron transport step is to determine the neutron flux
discretized by space and energy.  This neutron flux along with an irradiation
and decay scenario of interest are used as input into a nuclear inventory
code.  This code will give the photon flux as a function of decay time which
is then used as the source for the photon transport step.  A photon flux tally
fitted with flux-to-dose-rate conversion factors is used during this step to
determine the final SDR \cite{Chen_2002}.
