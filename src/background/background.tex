%%% BACKGROUND %%%
This work focuses on the nuclear analysis of systems that include activated, moving
components; specifically, parts of fusion energy systems that need to be moved
after shutdown for maintenance purposes.  
Systems that are exposed to intense
neutron irradiation become activated and decay via photon emission long after the
device has been shut down.  In order to accurately protect the maintenance
personnel that may be in the vicinity of the activated, moving components, it is
important to quantify the biological dose rate in the field.
