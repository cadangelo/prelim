\chapter{Variance Reduction for Time-integrated Multiphysics Analysis}\label{ch:ti}

The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Weighted Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS)
method of variance reduction 
was developed to optimize the primary radiation transport
%is used to formulate an adjoint neutron source
%that represents the importance of the neutrons to the final quantity of interest
%that captures both the potential of regions to become activated and produce
%decay photons that contribute to the SDR at the detector location.
%The solution resulting from the adjoint neutron transport with this source
%is used to generate biasing parameters that will optimize the neutron 
%transport step of
in a coupled, multi-step process. The first implementation of this method 
was applied to the coupled neutron activation-photon decay process that occurs
in FES.  
%Specifically, it
%was shown to decrease
%the variance in the neutron transport step of the R2S workflow
%was used to optimize the neutron transport step in the 
%SDR analysis of the 
%ITER SDR benchmark experiment \cite{mscadis}.
In its current form, MS-CADIS is only applicable to static systems where
the geometry remains unchanged in all steps of the multi-step process.

This chapter will first discuss MS-CADIS outside of the context of SDR analysis. 
Next, a time-integrated solution to the adjoint of the 
physical process occuring during geometry movement will be derived.  
Finally, this time-integrated solution will be applied to the GT-CADIS method to
form the TGT-CADIS adjoint neutron source that will optimize the neutron
transport step of SDR analysis.

\section{Generalized MS-CADIS Method}
In the current literature, MS-CADIS is primarily discussed as it applies to SDR
analysis \cite{mscadis}.  In actuality, MS-CADIS can be applied to any multi-step process in
which the primary radiation transport is coupled to a secondary physical process.
The addition of time integration to this methodology can also be applied to
any coupled multiphysics process. For this reason, it is prudent to discuss
MS-CADIS in a more generalized manner.

To describe the system of coupled, multiphysics,
the operator notation of the Boltzmann transport equation
\begin{equation}
	H\phi = q
\end{equation}
where H operates on the particle flux $\phi$ and q is a source of particles, 
will be used to represent the initial radiation transport and 
an equation of the same form 
\begin{equation}
	L\Psi = b
\end{equation}
where L operates on some function $\Psi$ and b is a source term, will be used
to describe a generic secondary physics. 
%Begin with 
The adjoint identity for the neutral particle transport
equation was given in Eq. \ref{eq:3.2b}.
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_identity}
%		\langle \phi(\overrightarrow{r},E), q^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle =
%		\langle \phi^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) , q(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle
%		\langle q^{+}, H\phi \rangle =
%		\langle H^{+}\phi^{+}, q \rangle
% \end{equation}
%where $\phi$ is the forward and 
%$\phi^{+}$ is the adjoint particle flux, and
%$q$ is the forward and 
%$q^{+}$ is the adjoint source distribution and 
%$\langle \cdot \rangle$ signifies the
%integration over all dependent variables.
This identity is valid for an arbitrary adjoint source function
\cite{l_m}, therefore the secondary physics has an adjoint identity of the same
form
\begin{center}
{$\langle \Psi^{+}, L\Psi \rangle = \langle \Psi, L^{+}\Psi^{+} \rangle $}
\end{center}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_2_identity}
	\langle \Psi^{+}, b \rangle =
	\langle \Psi, b^{+} \rangle 
\end{equation}
where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ signifies the integration over all dependent variables.
This is a two-step system, therefore the response of the secondary physics 
is the final response of interest and takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:response}
	R_{final} = \langle \sigma_b , \Psi \rangle
\end{equation}
According to the CADIS method, 
if the adjoint source is set equal to the detector response
function, the adjoint solution forms the importance function.
Substituting $b^{+}$ into Eq. \ref{eq:response} yields the following
%the left side of the identity in Eq. \ref{eq:adj_2_identity} has the same
%form as Eq. \ref{eq:response}
%if a detector response function is chosen as the adjoint source.
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:response_2}
%	 R_{final} = \langle \phi_{2}(\overrightarrow{r},E), q_{2}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle =
%		\langle \phi_{2}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) , q_{2}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle
	 R_{final} = \langle \Psi, b^{+} \rangle 
%		=\langle \Psi^{+} , b \rangle
 \end{equation}
Combining Eq. \ref{eq:response_2} with the adjoint identity yields
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_2}
%	 R_{final} = \langle \phi_{2}(\overrightarrow{r},E), q_{2}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle =
%		\langle \phi_{2}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) , q_{2}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle
	 R_{final} %= \langle \Psi, b^{+} \rangle 
		=\langle \Psi^{+} , b \rangle
 \end{equation}

For a coupled, multi-step process, the MS-CADIS method 
constrains the primary adjoint response such that it is equal to  
the final response of the system
%(i.e. the response of the secondary physics)
as shown below
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_1}
%	 R_{final} = \langle \phi_{1}(\overrightarrow{r},E), q_{1}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle =
%		\langle \phi_{1}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) , q_{1}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle
	 R_{final} = \langle \phi, q^{+} \rangle =
		\langle \phi^{+} , q \rangle
 \end{equation}

	 
 
% \todo{Unsure about symbols chosen for secondary physics and not listing
% explicit depedent variables here}

Ultimately, the goal is to find a solution to the adjoint
primary radiation transport to use as an importance
function for the forward calculation. Therefore, a
source for the adjoint radiation transport is needed.  Equating the adjoint
response equations in Eq. \ref{eq:adj_1} and \ref{eq:adj_2}, yields the expression in Eq.
\ref{eq:adj_src}.

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_src}
%	 \langle \phi_{1}(\overrightarrow{r},E), q_{1}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle =
%	 \langle \phi_{2}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E) , q_{2}(\overrightarrow{r},E) \rangle
	 \langle \phi, q^{+} \rangle =
	 \langle \Psi^{+}, b \rangle
 \end{equation}

In a practical scenario, the forward source of primary physics (e.g. neutron
source resulting from D-T fusion) will be known.  
The adjoint source of secondary physics is chosen to be the response function for the
detector of interest (e.g. flux-to-dose conversion factors).
Given that these sources are known, both solutions, $ \phi $ and
$\Psi^{+} $ can be found through transport operations.
The source of the forward secondary, $b$,  and adjoint primary physics,
$q^{+}$, are both unknown, therefore a second equation is needed.  
This is a coupled, multiphysics system where the source of the secondary physics is
a response of the primary radiation transport therefore the two processes can be related
by the following definition% \ref{eq:fwd_2src}

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:fwd_2src}
%	 q_{2}(\overrightarrow{r},E_{2}) =
%	 \langle \sigma_{1,2}, \phi_{1}(\overrightarrow{r},E_{1}) \rangle
	 b =
	 \langle \sigma_c, \phi \rangle
 \end{equation}
where $\sigma_c$ is a function that couples the primary
radiation transport to the secondary physics.

Consider the process of neutron-induced prompt photon production.
In this case, the function, $\sigma_c$, is the neutron-gamma production
cross section $\sigma_{n,\gamma}$.  The primary focus of SDR analysis
is the process of neutron-induced delayed gamma production. 
GT-CADIS provides a method for calculating $\sigma_c$ when
certain conditions (known as SNILB) hold true. In this case, the
coupling term, $T$, is an approximation of the transmutation
process \cite{gtcadis}.  As long as there is a solution for $\sigma_c$, the
function that couples the primary and secondary physics together,
there also exists a solution for the adjoint radiation transport source.
This can be discovered by substituting Eq. \ref{eq:fwd_2src} into Eq. 
\ref{eq:adj_src} and solving for $q^{+}$.

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_1src}
%	 q_{1}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E_{1}) = 
%	 \langle \sigma_{1,2}, \phi_{2}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r},E_{2}) \rangle
	 q^{+} = 
	 \langle \sigma_c, \Psi^{+} \rangle
 \end{equation}


%\section{Time-integrated Solution of Adjoint Secondary Transport}
\section{Time-integrated MS-CADIS}
If the configuration of the geometry is changing over time during
the secondary physics, it will affect the construction of the adjoint radiation
transport source, $q^{+}$.  
The solutions to both forward and adjoint transport will be calculated in discrete
volume elements.
Instead of a single solution to the adjoint secondary
physics, there is a solution at each position and each time.% represented by the term
\begin{itemize}
	\item	{$ \Psi^{+}(\overrightarrow{r}_{v}(t), t)$ Adjoint flux in volume
		element v at time t}
	\item  {$\overrightarrow{r}_{v}(t)$ Position of volume element v at
		time t}
\end{itemize}
To solve for the adjoint primary source in each volume element,
$q_{v}^{+}$, the time-dependent solutions of the 
adjoint secondary transport are combined by integrating over time

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_src_1_avg}
	 q_{v}^{+} =
	 \int_{t}  \Psi^{+}(\overrightarrow{r}_{v}(t), t)
	 \sigma_{c,v}(t)\, dt
 \end{equation}
%\todo{explain only sum, not average, is needed}
%\todo{This assumes that the coupling term $\sigma_{c,v}$
%does not change over time-- is that a fair assumption?}
This time-integrated source term is then used
for adjoint radiation transport to obtain $\phi_{v}^{+}$.

\section{Time-integrated GT-CADIS}
GT-CADIS is an implementation of MS-CADIS that is specific to SDR analysis.  It
provides a method to calculate a coupling term, T, that relates the neutron
flux to the photon source.
T is then used to solve for the adjoint neutron source as shown in Eq.
\ref{eq:gt_adj_nsrc}.
If the geometry configuration changes after shutdown, the time-integrated
MS-CADIS methodology shown in the previous section can be applied to the
GT-CADIS adjoint neutron source.
%Applying time integration to the GT-CADIS methodology results in the following
%solution for the adjoint neutron source

 \begin{equation}\label{eq:adj_src_1_avg}
	 q_{n,v}^{+}(E_{n}) =
	 \int_{t}  \int_{E_{\gamma}}
	 T_{v}(E_n, E_{\gamma}, t) 
	 \phi_{\gamma}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r}_{v}(t), E_{\gamma},t)
	 \, dE_{\gamma} \, dt
 \end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:sum}
%	\phi_{\gamma,v, h}^{+} = \sum_{t_{mov}}{\phi_{\gamma,v,h,t_{mov}}}
%\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\gamma}^{+}(\overrightarrow{r}_{v}(t), E_{\gamma},t) $ is the 
adjoint flux of photons of energy $E_{\gamma}$, in volume element v, at time t
and $T_{v}(E_n, E_{\gamma}, t) $ is the T value of the material in volume
element v, at decay time t.

There is a T value calculated for every volume element for every decay time of
interest.  For many practical problems, T will not change over the course of
geometry movement  because the time constants of decay and geometry
motion are very different.  The motion of components occurs over a very short
period of time relative to photon decay.  
Discretizing the energy spectrum into groups, the coupling term that relates 
the irradiation of the material in volume
element v, by neutrons in energy group g, to the corresponding source of
photons in energy group h, $T_{v,g,h}$, is found with Eq.
\ref{eq:T}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:T}
	T_{v,g,h} = \dfrac{q_{\gamma,v,h}(\phi_{n,v,g})}{\phi_{n,v,g}}
\end{equation}
Using this groupwise calculation of T, the integral in Eq. \ref{eq:adj_src_1_avg} can be estimated by the sum
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tgt_n_src}
	q_{n,v,g}^{+} =
	\sum_{t_{mov}}\Bigg(\sum_{h} T_{v,g,h} \phi_{\gamma,v,h,t_{mov}}^{+}\Bigg)
\end{equation}
where $t_{mov}$ is a time step after shutdown that corresponds to a change in
geometry configuration and $\phi_{\gamma,v,h,t_{mov}}^{+}$ is the adjoint flux
of photons in energy group h, in volume element v, at time step $t_{mov}$.
